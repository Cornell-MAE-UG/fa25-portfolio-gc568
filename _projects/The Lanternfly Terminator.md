# The Lanternfly Terminator

**Team:** Bug-anators
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement (most important)  
[Problem Statement] Grape farms supplying wineries and juice processors are increasingly impacted by Spotted Lanternflies (SLFs) during the growing and harvesting season. A Penn State-Cornell study found that more than 60% SLFs were harvested directly into 1.5-ton grape bins (up to 80% in some rows). Under current quality standards, a juice load may be rejected if just 1-2 insect fragments are detected in a 1,000-gram core sample. The grape vines also lose vitality after the SLF attaches to the vines. While current strategies focus on applying pesticides, they are too expensive as a constant preventive measure. Our plan focuses specifically on stopping adult SLFs from reaching and settling on vines by intercepting them at key hotspots and entry points in the vineyard. 
  

## Impact
[Impact] The NY grape industry is valued at $16.81 billion annually, but the increase in SLF infestations causes a significant decrease in this number. By keeping SLFs off grapevines pre-harvest, we reduce infestations. Once SLFs land on vines, they are difficult to control across an area and can rapidly degrade the quality of the harvest. Focusing on this issue lessens SLFs’ impact on product safety, taste, and the economic value of the harvested grapes. 

## Proposed direction(s)
[Proposed Direction: SLF Automated Scent Trap] Our concept is a scented (Tree of Heaven, etc.) SLF trap that attracts and eliminates them via an electric grid, adhesive, or mechanical suction trap. The device will be weather-proof and self-sufficient (power supply and SLF removal). The SLF would be collected in a section that the users can empty and switch out. 

How it will be used:
   Set up a trap at hotspot; apply the mechanism
   Scent lures SLF away from the grapevines

Why is it better than the status quo:
   Less Costly than Pesticides
   Avoids repeated harvester tool change

By the semester’s end, we aim to validate the functionality of our auto scent dispersion and elimination methods by testing flying objects similar to SLFs to get the desired response from the mechanism. 

[Key Risks / Unknowns] 
   Potential ecological impact on non-target species: Our device’s mechanisms might attract and harm pollinators and beneficial predators, affecting the vineyards’ ecosystem. To derisk: we can use a scent that minimizes the harm done to pollinators and conduct small-scale field tests.

   Maintenance and Usability: Devices require routine maintenance (clear dead insects, refill chemicals, supply power) across many acres of land, thus needing additional labor to operate. To derisk, a bigger capacity can be used to reduce the required maintenance times.

[Questions for the Clients]
1. Is this design worth pursuing due to the complex nature of what attracts SLFs?
2. Could this design work to eliminate or minimize the amount of SLF on grape vines?
3. What scents could attract SLF better than grape vines and have minimal harm on pollinators? 
4. How does one identify live hotspot locations for SLFs?
5. Can we hang this device on an existing Tree of Heaven/grape vine hotspot for SLF so we can eliminate the scent-releasing mechanism and focus on the trap/elimination method?
