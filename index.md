## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Gary Chau, and I am an MAE Undergraduate from Cornell dedicated to material testing, device design, and product development. Excelled in the optimization of the device design process of research leveraging CAD and analysis tools to bring ideas to life. Demonstrated exceptional project management skills and communication skills leading to impactful educational projects.

I hold interest in the product design field. Creating various mechanisms that peak my interest is what excells my desire to learn. I am very interested in the real world analysis of these mechanisms and how they would operate in the real world compared to theoretical model.
