For this class, we were asked to investigate the performance of a small liquid–liquid heat exchanger and analyze how its behavior changed under different operating conditions. The setup consisted of a stainless-steel heat exchanger block connected to two water circuits, each driven by a small pump. One loop was heated using an immersion heater to create a controlled “hot reservoir,” while the other loop was cooled with ice water to form the “cold reservoir.” Our goal was to compare how the device performed in parallel flow, counterflow, and counterflow with reduced flow rate, and then explain the observed results using the thermodynamic concepts we learned in the course.

Working with three classmates, we set up the system, measured inlet and outlet temperatures on both sides, and experimented with changing flow direction and flow rates. Before each run, we discussed what we expected the temperature profiles to look like and why counterflow should theoretically transfer more heat than parallel flow. We also considered how altering the cold-side pump rate would affect the temperature rise of the cold stream and the temperature drop of the hot stream.

As we ran the experiments, we continuously compared our predictions with the actual temperature measurements and tracked how the heat exchanger responded to each configuration. We found that parallel flow produced the lowest temperature changes, while counterflow allowed the cold stream to warm significantly more, even exceeding the hot-side outlet temperature, which matched what the theory predicts. Reducing the cold-side flow rate in counterflow further increased its exit temperature, reinforcing the idea that capacity-rate ratio plays a major role in heat-exchanger performance.

Overall, the experiment helped us directly connect the concepts of effectiveness, LMTD, and flow arrangement to real system behavior. It was also a hands-on way to reason through how design decisions—like flow direction and pump tuning—can impact the actual thermal performance of a heat exchanger.
