For a class, we were asked to design a frame in a 2D space of 150 cm long by 50 cm tall where we need to use a ridigd bar of a fixed length of your choosing with 3 pins, two which need to be connected to the ground and the linear actuator. However, the key is to make it so the frame/mechanism could lift to the highest possible maximum height while also supporting the highest maximum weight. The linear actuator was chosen from the cataloug given. Me and a few friends were able to discuss the best design after a few iterations. We kept discussion what would happen if we were to move the piston to certain locations on the bar and what forces the bars would experience and if the location of the bar/linear actuator would cause any torsion/bending (which we didn't want since they were both ridgid). We then ended up with the shown drawing with hand calculations provided to solve for the maximum height assuming all conditions were met.
